# lodmod_addon
A blender addon for creating lods

To use after installation in blender;

1) select objects you want lods for
2) at the top of the viewport go to the side panel under the tap "LODMOD"
3) choose how many lods you want and at what ratio you wish to decimate them (lower value = less verts)
4) press the "Create LOD's" button and you're done!
