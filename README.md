# lodmod_addon
A blender addon for creating lods

To use after installation in blender;

1) select objects you want lods for
2) at the top of the viewport go to the side panel under the tap "LODMOD"
3) choose how many lods you want
4) choose what ratio you wish to decimate them (lower value = less verts)
5) choose if you wish to apply the modifier stacks automatically
6) choose if you wish to add the _LOD0 suffix to the original object
7) choose if you want to offset the LODs so you can see them in a lineup (default offset 0)
8) press the "Create LOD's" button and you're done!
